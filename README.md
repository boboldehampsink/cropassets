=================

Plugin/FieldType that allows you to crop an asset and show it in the front-end.

__Important__  
The plugin's folder should be named "cropassets"

Deprecated
=================

With the release of Craft 3 on 4-4-2018, this plugin has been deprecated. You can still use this with Craft 2 but you are encouraged to use (and develop) a Craft 3 version. At this moment, I have no plans to do so.

Usage
=================
This plugin provides a Crop Assets FieldType that works like the Asset FieldType.  
You can upload/select an asset and a crop modal will appear.
After cropping you can show the cropped asset in the front-end.

Roadmap
=================
 - Saving of the cropped asset in stead of real-time cropping it?

Changelog
=================
### 1.0.2 ###
